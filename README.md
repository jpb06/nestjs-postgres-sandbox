## :zap: What is this repo about?

This is a sandbox to evaluate nestjs and dig how fun it is to implement typical requirements for a backend, with an enphasis on testing, given how dearly missed this requirement can be in 'real world' examples found here and there.

## :zap: Stack

So let's talk about the stack (pushing on an open door here, but hey):

## :zap: Guidelines

### :diamonds: Schema splitting

We do not want a huge prisma schema. We want to isolate each model (table or set of tables) in its own file.

### :diamonds: Well documented routes

Let's have a swagger documenting properly exposed routes, that is mainly for each route:

- a description.
- the list of possible responses.
- a definition of the inputs and outputs.

### :diamonds: Full testing coverage

We want to test everything to learn how to properly test, and to face every single difficulty that comes with testing. We will at very least do end to end using superagent, controllers testing, service testing.

### :diamonds: No testing against the database

All tests should run without any interaction with a database.

## :zap: Usage

### :diamonds: run locally

:point_down: Since our prisma schemas are split within modules, we will have to merge them all in one file prisma can understand. Let's do just that:

```bash
yarn prisma:merge
```

:point_down: Now, we need to tell prisma to generate in node_modules the code actually allowing us to interact with the database:

```bash
yarn prisma:gen
```

:point_down: You will need docker and docker-compose to get the postgres database up and running. You can use this command to launch the database container:

```bash
yarn dev:db
```

:point_down: Then, let's inject some data in our dev database using:

```bash
yarn prisma:seed
```

:point_down: We can now launch the backend in dev:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### :diamonds: test all the things

:point_down: We can run all the tests and get a coverage report using the following:

```bash
yarn test:dev
```

## :zap: Subjects

### :diamonds: Authentication

Let's use passport to setup jwt based authentication.

#### :rocket: Routes

Two routes were defined to demonstrate the use case:

| Route             | Description                   | Documentation                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST /user/login  | The login route               | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/users/UsersController_login)      |
| GET /user/profile | Logged user profile retrieval | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/users/UsersController_getProfile) |

#### :books: Mock data

We have two users in database to play with the routes:

- alice@cool.org / alice
- bob@cool.org / bob

#### ðŸ§ª Tests

- :white_check_mark: e2e
- :white_check_mark: controllers
- :white_check_mark: services
- :white_check_mark: local passport strategy

### :diamonds: CRUD

Let's create CRUD routes to manage a list of books.

#### :rocket: Routes

| Route                   | Description                             | Documentation                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET /books              | Retrieves all books                     | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/Books/BooksController_getBooks)         |
| GET /authors            | Retrieves all authors                   | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/authors/AuthorsController_getAuthors)   |
| GET /authors/{id}/books | Retrieves the book written by an author | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/Books/AuthorsController_getAuthorBooks) |
| POST /books             | Creates a book                          | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/Books/BooksController_createBook)       |
| POST /authors           | Creates an author                       | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/authors/AuthorsController_createAuthor) |
| PUT /books/{id}         | Updates a book                          | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/Books/BooksController_updateBook)       |
| PUT /authors/{id}       | Updates an author                       | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/authors/AuthorsController_updateAuthor) |
| DELETE /books/{id}      | Deletes a book                          | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/Books/BooksController_deleteBook)       |
| DELETE /authors/{id}    | Deletes an author                       | [Link](https://nestjs-prisma-postgres.herokuapp.com/#/authors/AuthorsController_deleteAuthor) |

#### ðŸ§ª Tests

- :white_check_mark: e2e
- :white_check_mark: controllers (turns out these are pretty much useless since we mock the service)
- :white_check_mark: services
- :white_check_mark: validation pipe
